  <h2><p>hey there! thanks for visiting my page. let me introduce myself...my name is michelle dugan, i am 21 year old new jersey native studying graphic design
    at boston university. an ideal night for me is sitting infront of the fireplace, watching the kardashians and petting my dog. you too? i think we will get along well!</p>
    <p>i like to have fun with my design work. i like working with lots of bright color, although you will (always catch me in a black t shirt and jeans) and HELVETICA!
      lots of helvetica. recently i have been inspired by edgy fashion photography and incorporating it in my designs. check out some of my work on my gallery page!</p>
